# AlgoBee Profile Page & Studio Blueprint

## Overview
A modern, tech-focused platform for the character "AlgoBee". It features an AI-driven Question Generation Studio and a showcase of published question sets.

## Project Details
- **Character Name:** AlgoBee
- **Features:**
    - **Modern Aesthetics**: Uses 'Inter' font and clean, spacious UI elements.
    - **Question Generator Studio**: A 5-step messenger-style interactive tool to create question sets.
    - **Question Set Listing**: `index.html` displays published question sets saved in `localStorage`.
    - **About Page (`about.html`)**: A detailed introduction to AlgoBee Studio's features and mission.
    - **Response Page (`respond.html`)**: A dedicated page for users to answer published question sets.
    - **Static Experience**: No animations or unnecessary movement, focusing on content and clarity.

## Current Plan: Connect Studio to Home Page
1. **Save Functionality**: Update `main.js` to save published sets to `localStorage`.
2. **List Display**: Update `index.html` to dynamically list saved question sets.
3. **Response Page**: Create `respond.html` to handle the actual answering process.
4. **Navigation**: Ensure smooth flow from Creation -> Home -> Responding.
